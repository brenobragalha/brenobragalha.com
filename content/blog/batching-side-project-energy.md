I love starting side projects but hate the part where the calendar slips, motivation fades, and the repo grows stale. The fix was not "more discipline" — it was batching the energy input. Here is the cadence that keeps my experiments shipping while my day job stays healthy.

*The cadence I use to keep side projects moving without burning out.*

## 1. Set a season, not a deadline

Rather than promising "launch the tool by December", I define **seasons** that last 6–8 weeks. Each season gets a slogan (`"Reduce friction"`, `"Ship the workflow"`, etc.) plus three measurable outcomes. When the season ends, I celebrate and archive, even if the backlog is not empty.

## 2. Protect two maker slots per week

- One 120-minute slot on a weeknight for exploration (new APIs, sketches, prompts).
- One 180-minute weekend slot for execution (shipping features, writing docs, polishing UI).

If a week implodes, I move the sessions but never delete them. This keeps the project humming without demanding daily attention.

## 3. Run a Friday fuel audit

Every Friday afternoon I write three bullets:

1. **Energy leaks** — meetings, chores, or context switches that drained momentum.
2. **Energy sparks** — anything that made the project feel inevitable (user feedback, a new plugin, etc.).
3. **Micro-resets** — quick wins that unblock the next session.

The audit takes five minutes and prevents carrying invisible stress into the weekend session.

## 4. Ship in narrative chunks

Instead of random commits, I align each push with a narrative slice: "onboarding flow", "prompt evaluation harness", "pricing page". I open a short changelog entry in Notion (soon Obsidian!) and drop screenshots, gifs, and metrics. Sharing these slices on social makes the work legible and keeps friends engaged as accountability partners.

## 5. Close the loop with public notes

I publish a short retro at the end of every season: what shipped, what missed, what I am pausing. This public artifact keeps expectations realistic and provides a breadcrumb trail for anyone following along.

Side projects are marathons disguised as sprints. Batching the energy input — seasons, protected slots, fuel audits, narrative slices — keeps the engine warm so the next idea does not stall the moment life gets busy.
