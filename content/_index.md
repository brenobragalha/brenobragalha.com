I'm a Software Engineer currently building solutions for the Fintech market mainly with the Java ecosystem. I also love creating my own stuff using all kinds of languages and paradigms, messing with on-prem setups, and testing questionable tools and approaches just for the fun of it.

I've been modifying game files and taking apart hardware since I was 12 to see how things worked inside. That early curiosity eventually led to a formal education in Systems Analysis and a specialization in Full-stack Development.
